# Team Handoff Document

## âœ… Modularization Complete!

Your fact-checking agent has been successfully restructured into a clean, modular architecture that your backend and frontend team can easily work with.

## What Was Accomplished

```markdown
- [x] Split monolithic agent.py into 6 focused modules
- [x] Created clean class-based architecture  
- [x] Separated configuration from business logic
- [x] Centralized all prompts for easy modification
- [x] Added comprehensive error handling
- [x] Created documentation and README
- [x] Added test validation for structure
- [x] Preserved all original functionality
```

## New File Structure

| File | Purpose | Team Focus |
|------|---------|------------|
| `main.py` | Entry point - just runs the pipeline | **Both teams** |
| `config.py` | Settings, API keys, user input | **Backend** - easy to convert to API params |
| `fact_checker.py` | Core FactChecker class | **Backend** - main business logic |
| `evidence_search.py` | Evidence searching logic | **Backend** - data gathering |
| `prompts.py` | All LLM prompt templates | **Both teams** - easy to modify |
| `utils.py` | Helper functions, formatting | **Frontend** - display logic |
| `README.md` | Documentation | **Both teams** |

## For Your Backend Team

### Easy API Integration
```python
# Simple API endpoint example
from fact_checker import FactChecker

@app.route('/analyze', methods=['POST'])
def analyze_article():
    data = request.json
    
    fact_checker = FactChecker(
        gemini_api_key=GEMINI_KEY,
        serper_api_key=SERPER_KEY
    )
    
    result = fact_checker.analyze_article(
        article={'link': data['url']},
        max_chars=data.get('max_chars', 3000),
        sources_per_claim=data.get('sources_per_claim', 5)
    )
    
    return jsonify(result)
```

### Key Classes to Use:
- **`FactChecker`** - Main analysis pipeline
- **`EvidenceSearcher`** - For custom evidence gathering
- **`Config`** - For environment/settings management

## For Your Frontend Team

### Expected Data Flow
```javascript
// Input to backend
{
  "url": "https://example.com/article",
  "max_chars": 3000,
  "sources_per_claim": 5
}

// Output from backend
{
  "title": "Article Title",
  "url": "https://...",
  "summary": "Five sentence summary...",
  "verified_claims": [
    {
      "claim": "Specific claim text",
      "verdict": "True|False|Misleading|Needs context|Unverifiable", 
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "evidence_quality": "Strong|Moderate|Weak|Insufficient",
      "reasoning": "Why this verdict was reached..."
    }
  ],
  "analysis": "Ethics professor review..."
}
```

### Display Components Needed:
- Article summary card
- Claims list with verdict badges
- Confidence meters/progress bars
- Evidence quality indicators
- Ethics analysis section

## Key Benefits Achieved

1. **Separation of Concerns** - Each file has one clear responsibility
2. **Easy Testing** - Individual components can be tested separately  
3. **Scalable** - Backend can easily add API endpoints
4. **Maintainable** - Frontend can modify display without touching logic
5. **Configurable** - Prompts and settings centralized for easy changes

## Migration from Original Code

Your original `agent.py` (690 lines) is preserved as a backup. The new modular version maintains 100% compatibility but with much better organization:

- **Before**: Everything mixed together in one file
- **After**: Clean separation with focused responsibilities

## Next Steps for Your Team

1. **Backend**: Focus on `fact_checker.py` and `config.py` for API integration
2. **Frontend**: Study the JSON output format in `utils.py` for display planning
3. **Both**: Customize prompts in `prompts.py` as needed
4. **Testing**: Run `python test_structure.py` to validate setup

## Quick Start Reminder

```bash
# Install dependencies (if not already done)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Test the modular structure
python test_structure.py

# Run the original functionality (now modular)
python main.py
```

**Your fact-checking agent is now ready for hackathon development! ðŸš€**

The modular structure will make it much easier for your team to:
- Add new features without breaking existing code
- Work on different parts simultaneously
- Debug and test individual components
- Scale for production use

Good luck with your hackathon! ðŸŽ¯
