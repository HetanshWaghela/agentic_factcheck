Fallacy of Relevance,Ad Hominem,Attacks the person (subject) and uses that as a premise for the claim.,Yes,Premises are irrelevant to the conclusion; example: attacking an ex‑convict’s credibility to dismiss penal system suggestions.
Fallacy of Relevance,Ad Populum,Asserts a claim based on popular belief (appeal to the people).,Yes,"E.g., 'Aliens must exist because most people believe in them.'"
Fallacy of Relevance,Appeal to Emotion,Manipulates the listener’s emotions to support the claim.,Yes,Includes pity/fear/etc.; premises are emotionally charged but irrelevant.
Fallacy of Relevance,Fallacy of Extension,Exaggerates or extends an opponent’s position to make it easier to attack.,Yes,Closely related to 'straw man' style extensions.
Fallacy of Relevance,Intentional,Uses subconscious or intentional choices to incorrectly support an argument.,No,Marked with dotted boundary in Figure 1; excluded due to ambiguous mapping.
Fallacy of Defective Induction,False Causality,Concludes a causal relation not warranted by the premises.,Yes,Correlation or temporal sequence treated as causation.
Fallacy of Defective Induction,False Dilemma,Erroneously limits the options available to force a conclusion.,Yes,Presents two choices where more exist.
Fallacy of Defective Induction,Faulty Generalization,Generalizes from insufficient or unrepresentative evidence.,Yes,"E.g., infers a broad claim from a single or few cases."
Fallacy of Defective Induction,Fallacy of Credibility,Questions the credibility of the subject making a claim instead of the claim itself.,Yes,Credibility-based induction problem distinct from pure relevance attack.
Fallacy of Defective Induction,Fallacy of Logic,Uses an inaccurate or misleading logical construct.,No,Dotted in Figure 1; excluded in experimental mapping.
Fallacy of Presumption,Circular Reasoning,The conclusion is assumed in the premises; argument returns to its starting point.,Yes,Also known as 'circulus in probando'.
Fallacy of Presumption,Begging the Question,Treats the conclusion as an assumption that supports itself.,No,Marked dotted / out of scope in this study.
Fallacy of Presumption,Complex Question,Asks a loaded question that presupposes an unproven assumption.,No,Marked dotted / out of scope in this study.
Fallacy of Presumption,Accident,Applies a generalization to specific cases where it doesn’t fit.,No,Marked dotted / out of scope in this study.
Fallacy of Ambiguity,Equivocation,A key word/phrase shifts meaning across premises/conclusion.,Yes,Different contextual meanings cause ambiguity in logic.
Fallacy of Ambiguity,Amphiboly,Ambiguity arises from grammatical structure leading to misinterpretation.,No,Marked dotted / not used in experiments.
Fallacy of Ambiguity,Accent,Meaning changes due to emphasis on different parts of a sentence or phrase.,No,Marked dotted / not used in experiments.
Fallacy of Ambiguity,Composition,Infers that a whole has attributes just because its parts do.,No,Marked dotted / not used in experiments.
Fallacy of Ambiguity,Division,Infers that parts have attributes just because the whole does.,No,Marked dotted / not used in experiments.
